    <h2>These are the main three reasons I love Weight Lifting and Exercise</h2>
    <ol>

            <ul>
                <li>For me personally, I have been able to have so much joy from having an outlet. God was able to give me a way to embrace who I am and console me when I was in a difficult time in my life.</li>
                <li>I have been able to overcome challenges and obstacles which have been able to help me be an anchor for others and be a light!</li>
                <li>There has been so much growth in myself and I can look back and see who I was to who I am now and know that I am better today than I was yesterday.</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li>There are so many health benefits towards working out!
            <ul>

                <li>Mentally I have been able to heal from past traumas and not only myself but others have overcome mental issues and much more through training consistently.</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
